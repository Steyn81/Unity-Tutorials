  storyText: 'B6. Running

    You run down a long corridor then up a flight of
    metal stairs. They make a loud racket as you clamber up them. Thank goodness
    the machinery in this place is so loud.

    

    In front of you is the emergency
    exit door. It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle.
    You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry it off.

    

    What
    to do?

    

    1. Pick it.

    2. Pry it.'
